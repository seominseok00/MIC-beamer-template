	abstract = {FOUR-WHEEL STEERING (4WS) is beginning to find widespread use
                as a new approach to improving vehicle dynamics, especially in
                the medium and high speed ranges. Steering the rear wheels in
                the same phase as the front wheels enhances vehicle stability.
                Four-wheel steering systems have an even greater potential to
                improve stability and steering response through suitable
                control over the transient characteristics of the rear wheel
                steer angle. This paper traces the course of Nissan research
                and development work on four-wheel steering and the evolution
                of Nissan's HICAS (4WS) technology. It also describes research
                activities under way on vehicle dynamics using a newly
                developed Simulator Vehicle, equipped with a front and rear
                angle transient control system which makes it possible to vary
                the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle instantaneously and
                at will while driving.},

@article{Park:2025aa,
	abstract = {With the increasing demand for various autonomous driving services in urban environments, low-speed autonomous vehicles, such as autonomous shuttles and purpose-built vehicles, equipped with enhanced driving characteristics suitable for urban roads featuring narrow streets, intersections, congested traffic, and small radii, are emerging. In particular, the 4WS (four-wheel steering) system, which is being integrated into these vehicles, is designed to steer both the front and rear wheels. This system improves steering responsiveness and stability, providing maneuverability under various driving conditions and making it highly suitable for urban environments. However, the 4WS system involves complex dynamic modeling and poses challenges in designing a path tracker, especially if factors such as the vehicle's turning radius and road curvature are not properly considered. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a path tracker for a low-speed autonomous driving system based on a 4WS system, optimized for the characteristics of urban roads to minimize the vehicle's turning radius and enhance driving performance. The proposed path tracker independently controls the front and rear wheels and incorporates road curvature and vehicle turning radius as feedforward terms to improve the response performance of the path tracker. The performance of the proposed path tracker was evaluated through simulations and real-car experiments.},

	abstract = {In the 1980's, rear-wheel steering systems were widely spread among Japanese automobiles for improvement in making a small turn at a low velocity as a main purpose. However, almost all the rear-wheel steering systems disappeared due to high cost and unnatural feeling at the time of steering. Recently, the increasing number of manufactures adopt the rear-wheel steering systems for purposes of improving steering responsiveness and vehicle stability. However, it is strongly recognized that the unnatural feeling given to a driver, which is represented by ``teacup-ride like feeling'', during anti-phase steering at the low velocity is a characteristic of the rear wheel steering. In this study, control laws were developed with a side-slip angle and a yaw rate being set as target vehicle characteristics, and a large-angle rear-wheel steering system perfecting natural feeling and small-turn performance was developed.},

	abstract = {This study investigates a control strategy for torque vectoring (TV) and active rear wheel steering (RWS) using feedforward and feedback control schemes for different circumstances. A comprehensive vehicle and combined slip tire model are used to determine the secondary effect and to generate desired yaw acceleration and side slip angle rate. A model-based feedforward controller is designed to improve handling but not to track an ideal response. A feedback controller based on close loop observation is used to ensure its cornering stability. The fusion of two controllers is used to stabilize a vehicle's lateral motion. To increase lateral performance, an optimization-based control allocation distributes the wheel torques according to the remaining tire force potential. The simulation results show that a vehicle with the proposed controller exhibits more responsive lateral dynamic behavior and greater maximum lateral acceleration. The cornering safety is also demonstrated using a standard stability test. The driving performance and stability are improved simultaneously by the proposed control strategy and the optimal control allocation scheme.},

The linear lateral dynamics of 4WS vehicles are deduced and then analysed, aided with three-dimensional graphs. To improve vehicle handling and stability at high speed, a multiobjective H ∞ optimal control algorithm is presented, while yaw rate is the only feedback signal. Simulation shows that the sideslip angle, yaw rate, and lateral acceleration of the 4WS vehicle follow and maintain preferable characteristics. The 4WS vehicle is agile and consistent with the steering input and does not understeer excessively. },

	abstract = {This study addresses the performance of four-wheel-steering
                vehicles in high-speed lane change manoeuvres. The study
                compares the recorded steering command of an experienced driver
                in executing a lane change manoeuvre with that determined via
                solving a suitably formulated optimization problem.The study
                found them to be qualitatively comparable. This finding allows
                an analytical comparison of the optimal lane change performance
                achievable with both two and four-wheel-steering vehicles. For
                a representative high-speed lane change manoeuvre, the study
                revealed that, in the hands of an experienced driver, the
                performance benefit achievable with four-wheel-steering
                vehicles is not significant. This conclusion is in agreement
                with road test results obtained with two production
                four-wheel-steering vehicles. The applicability of the proposed
                ``optimal control'' approach in evaluating the performance of

	abstract = { AbstractRecent trends of vehicle chassis control are reviewed, paying attention to the basic nature of the vehicle dynamics, tyre characteristics and the effectiveness and limit of four-wheel steering (4WS) and direct yaw moment control (DYC). It is pointed out that, taking the non-linear characteristics of tyre and vehicle dynamics into consideration, change in chassis control from 4WS to DYC inevitably improves handling performance and active safety in vehicle motion with larger slip angles and/or higher lateral accelerations. Emphasis is placed on the need to propose a control strategy based on thorough observation and understanding of the tyre and vehicle dynamics. A side slip model following DYC by sliding control is introduced and the effects of the control are discussed. },

	abstract = {Mechatronical components are becoming increasingly important in the control of vehicle dynamics. In this paper an innovative approach to networking chassis domain actuators (e.g. rear wheel steering, wheel individual electric drives, active differentials etc.) is presented. By combining state of the art approaches for nonlinear model based feed forward control with an innovative concept to dealing with non quadratic control systems, lateral dynamics performance and driving safety can be enhanced. For this new approach the denotation ``Integrated Vehicle Dynamics Control'' (IVC) is introduced. Besides objective performance issues, a natural, reproducible and reliable vehicle behavior during all possible types of driving maneuvers was a major development goal. In Addition to this control concept, a new calibration strategy based on four essential, intuitive driving properties is presented. Through measurement results it is shown, that, by applying this new technology, the side slip angle during an aggressive lane change maneuver can be reduced by a factor of five compared to a standard Electronic Stability Controller (ESC). Regarding a typical maneuver for performance assessment -- 36 m slalom -- with IVC the maximum vehicle speed can be enhanced by 7 kph compared to test runs without any type of lateral dynamics control.},

@article{Tsukamoto:2021aa,
	abstract = {Contraction theory is an analytical tool to study differential dynamics of a non-autonomous (i.e., time-varying) nonlinear system under a contraction metric defined with a uniformly positive definite matrix, the existence of which results in a necessary and sufficient characterization of incremental exponential stability of multiple solution trajectories with respect to each other. By using a squared differential length as a Lyapunov-like function, its nonlinear stability analysis boils down to finding a suitable contraction metric that satisfies a stability condition expressed as a linear matrix inequality, indicating that many parallels can be drawn between well-known linear systems theory and contraction theory for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, contraction theory takes advantage of a superior robustness property of exponential stability used in conjunction with the comparison lemma. This yields much-needed safety and stability guarantees for neural network-based control and estimation schemes, without resorting to a more involved method of using uniform asymptotic stability for input-to-state stability. Such distinctive features permit systematic construction of a contraction metric via convex optimization, thereby obtaining an explicit exponential bound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and solution trajectories perturbed externally due to disturbances and learning errors. The objective of this paper is therefore to present a tutorial overview of contraction theory and its advantages in nonlinear stability analysis of deterministic and stochastic systems, with an emphasis on deriving formal robustness and stability guarantees for various learning-based and data-driven automatic control methods. In particular, we provide a detailed review of techniques for finding contraction metrics and associated control and estimation laws using deep neural networks.},

@article{Sheu:2020aa,
	abstract = {<p>Psychiatric research is often confronted with complex abstractions and dynamics that are not readily accessible or well-defined to our perception and measurements, making data-driven methods an appealing approach. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are capable of automatically learning abstractions in the data that can be entirely novel and have demonstrated superior performance over classical machine learning models across a range of tasks and, therefore, serve as a promising tool for making new discoveries in psychiatry. A key concern for the wider application of DNNs is their reputation as a ``black box'' approach---i.e., they are said to lack transparency or interpretability of how input data are transformed to model outputs. In fact, several existing and emerging tools are providing improvements in interpretability. However, most reviews of interpretability for DNNs focus on theoretical and/or engineering perspectives. This article reviews approaches to DNN interpretability issues that may be relevant to their application in psychiatric research and practice. It describes a framework for understanding these methods, reviews the conceptual basis of specific methods and their potential limitations, and discusses prospects for their implementation and future directions.</p>},

Our results settle an open question about representability in the class of single hidden layer neural networks. In particular, we show that arbitrary decision regions can be arbitrarily well approximated by continuous feedforward neural networks with only a single internal, hidden layer and any continuous sigmoidal nonlinearity. The paper discusses approximation properties of other possible types of nonlinearities that might be implemented by artificial neural networks.}},

@article{Saerens:1991aa,
	abstract = { The paper investigates the possibility of using a simple approximation for evaluating the error which must be back-propagated to allow a neural net to learn to control a plant in an adaptive way. The algorithm is based on an approximation of the Jacobian of the plant. The method is applied to five simulations. The first two simulations allow a comparison between the proposed algorithm and the standard back-propagation, for which the error to be back-propagated is precisely known. The results for the two methods show equivalent performances, and equivalent convergence time, for the test problems. This shows that the rate of convergence of the neural net does not seem to depend crucially on the values of the Jacobian. The last three simulations investigate the possibility of online adaptive learning. The results show that control based on some approximation of theJacobian is possible for a neural network. },

	abstract = { The classical Universal Approximation Theorem holds for neural networks of arbitrary width and bounded depth. Here we consider the natural `dual' scenario for networks of bounded width and arbitrary depth. Precisely, let $n$ be the number of inputs neurons, $m$ be the number of output neurons, and let $\rho$ be any nonaffine continuous function, with a continuous nonzero derivative at some point. Then we show that the class of neural networks of arbitrary depth, width $n + m + 2$, and activation function $\rho$, is dense in $C(K; \mathbb{R}^m)$ for $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ with $K$ compact. This covers every activation function possible to use in practice, and also includes polynomial activation functions, which is unlike the classical version of the theorem, and provides a qualitative difference between deep narrow networks and shallow wide networks. We then consider several extensions of this result. In particular we consider nowhere differentiable activation functions, density in noncompact domains with respect to the $L^p$-norm, and how the width may be reduced to just $n + m + 1$ for `most' activation functions.},

@inproceedings{Taylor:2016aa,
	abstract = {With the growing importance of large network models and enormous training datasets, GPUs have become increasingly necessary to train neural networks. This is largely because conventional optimization algorithms rely on stochastic gradient methods that don't scale well to large numbers of cores in a cluster setting. Furthermore, the convergence of all gradient methods, including batch methods, suffers from common problems like saturation effects, poor conditioning, and saddle points. This paper explores an unconventional training method that uses alternating direction methods and Bregman iteration to train networks without gradient descent steps. The proposed method reduces the network training problem to a sequence of minimization sub-steps that can each be solved globally in closed form. The proposed method is advantageous because it avoids many of the caveats that make gradient methods slow on highly non-convex problems. In addition, the method exhibits strong scaling in the distributed setting, yielding linear speedups even when split over thousands of cores.},

@article{Vasquez-Plaza:2023aa,
	abstract = {System dynamic models for hundreds of inverter-based generators are necessary to represent the whole behavior and to perform stability analysis at the transmission and distribution level in the electric power system. Aggregated models such as DER-A and PVD1 have been proposed, however, they have many parameters and there is currently no methodology to parameterize them. Many of the parameterization methods for this type of model require only smooth functions. Because these models have non-linear blocks, such as saturation and dead-band functions, this paper proposes a smooth mathematical representation of the DER-A aggregated model. The proposed smooth mathematical representation uses a novel smooth function proposed to represent the saturation function and further uses a proposed method to obtain a smooth dead-band function from the proposed smooth saturation function. Finally, the impact of the use of smooth functions on the dynamics of the DER-A model states is experimentally presented and it is also demonstrated by means of electrical signals that the proposed smooth mathematical representation can represent the dynamics of the aggregated DER-A model, paving a way for future research on parameter identification and stability assessment of the aggregated inverter-based generation models.},

In addition, based on these observations we propose a dynamical schedule for the regularization parameter that improves performance and speeds up training. We test these proposals in modern image classification settings. Finally, we show that these empirical relations can be understood theoretically in the context of infinitely wide networks.

Control action is used to achieve tracking performance for a state-feedback linearizable but unknown nonlinear system. The control structure consists of a feedback linearization portion provided by two neural networks, plus a robustifying portion that keeps the control magniture bounded. A stability proof is given in the sense of Lyapunov. It is shown that all the signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. No off-line learning phase is needed; initialization of the network weights is straightforward.},

@article{Sengupta:2014aa,
	abstract = {Data assimilation is a fundamental issue that arises across many scales in neuroscience --- ranging from the study of single neurons using single electrode recordings to the interaction of thousands of neurons using fMRI. Data assimilation involves inverting a generative model that can not only explain observed data but also generate predictions. Typically, the model is inverted or fitted using conventional tools of (convex) optimization that invariably extremise some functional --- norms, minimum descriptive length, variational free energy, etc. Generally, optimisation rests on evaluating the local gradients of the functional to be optimized. In this paper, we compare three different gradient estimation techniques that could be used for extremising any functional in time --- (i) finite differences, (ii) forward sensitivities and a method based on (iii) the adjoint of the dynamical system. We demonstrate that the first-order gradients of a dynamical system, linear or non-linear, can be computed most efficiently using the adjoint method. This is particularly true for systems where the number of parameters is greater than the number of states. For such systems, integrating several sensitivity equations -- as required with forward sensitivities -- proves to be most expensive, while finite-difference approximations have an intermediate efficiency. In the context of neuroimaging, adjoint based inversion of dynamical causal models (DCMs) can, in principle, enable the study of models with large numbers of nodes and parameters.},

@inproceedings{Wang:2019aa,
	abstract = {Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has been used successfully in many conventional machine learning applications and is considered to be a useful alternative to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a deep learning optimizer. However, as an emerging domain, several challenges remain, including 1) The lack of global convergence guarantees, 2) Slow convergence towards solutions, and 3) Cubic time complexity with regard to feature dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework for deep learning via ADMM (dlADMM) to address these challenges simultaneously. The parameters in each layer are updated backward and then forward so that the parameter information in each layer is exchanged efficiently. The time complexity is reduced from cubic to quadratic in (latent) feature dimensions via a dedicated algorithm design for subproblems that enhances them utilizing iterative quadratic approximations and backtracking. Finally, we provide the first proof of global convergence for an ADMM-based method (dlADMM) in a deep neural network problem under mild conditions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrated that our proposed dlADMM algorithm outperforms most of the comparison methods.},

	abstract = {Image stabilization is important for snake robots to be used as mobile robots. In this paper, we propose an adaptive robust RBF neural network nonsingular terminal sliding mode control to reduce swinging in the snake robot's head while it is being driven. To avoid complex dynamic problems and reduce interference during driving, we propose a 2-DOF snake robot's head system. We designed the control system based on the nonsingular terminal sliding mode control, which ensures a fast response and finite time convergence. To reduce chattering, we incorporated an RBF neural network that can compensate for disturbances. Additionally, we included an adaptive robust term to address the disadvantages of neural network-based control. The adaptive robust term generates control inputs based on the error and is used in conjunction with the reverse saturation function to eliminate chattering. The update law of the neural network and the adaptive robust term is designed based on Lyapunov's theory. We proved the stability of the proposed controller by investigating finite time convergence before and after the reverse saturation function operation section. Finally, we verified the performance of the proposed controller through computer simulation. The simulation evaluates the controllers using a sinusoidal reference signal similar to snake robot movement and a mixed reference signal considering the controller's waste case. The proposed controller has excellent tracking performance and improved chattering compared with the previous controller.},

Despite most of proposed control schemes for saturated systems which employed linear in parameter neural networks (LPNNs), in the present work nonlinear in parameter neural network (NLPNN) is introduced to support global approximation property. To compensate the effect of the input saturation constraint an auxiliary system is introduced and the error dynamics are modified based on the auxiliary states. Then, learning rules are achieved based on the back propagation (BP) algorithm and by adding two robustifying terms to the standard BP learning rules the stability of the overall system is ensured via Lyapunov direct method. Finally simulations performed on a ``generalized pendulum'' nonlinear system to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking control scheme.},

	abstract = {From the Publisher:This graduate text provides an authoritative account of neural network (NN) controllers for robotics and nonlinear systems and gives the first textbook treatment of a general and streamlined design procedure for NN controllers. Stability proofs and performance guarantees are provided which illustrate the superior efficiency of the NN controllers over other design techniques when the system is unknown. New NN properties, such as robustness and passivity are introduced, and new weight tuning algorithms are presented. Neural Network Control of Robot Manipulators and Nonlinear Systems provides a welcome introduction to graduate students, and an invaluable reference to professional engineers and researchers in control systems.},
